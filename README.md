## 📌 Overview
A portfolio of the deliverables and analytical work produced during the Deloitte-sponsored Data Analytics virtual experience program on Forage. This simulation offered practical exposure to key data analytics workflows and client scenarios, demonstrating foundational skills applicable to a career at Deloitte.

## 🎯 Simulation Objectives
The Deloitte Data Analytics simulation aimed to:
* Develop skills in data visualization and dashboard creation
* Enhance analytical thinking for business problem-solving
* Understand how to communicate insights effectively to stakeholders

## 🛠️  Assigned Tasks
* Task 1. Process and analyze one month of high-frequency machine telemetry data (from 36 machines across 4 factories) to pinpoint the plant with the most frequent breakdowns and the specific machines causing the most downtime.
* Task 2.  Build upon the Forensic Tech team's foundation to complete an algorithm that measures pay equity, enabling us to identify and address disparities across all roles within the company.

## 🛠️ Tools used
* Tableau – For Data Visualization
* Excel - For Analyze And Identify Data

## 📄 Task
### Task 1. Analyze one month of high-frequency machine telemetry data
1. Create Down Time Per Factory Chart from data telemetry.
2. Create Down Time Per Machine from data telemetry.
3. Create Dashboard to gain more information.


### Task 2. Identify and address disparities across all roles and global locations
1. Create a 4th column (Equality class)
2. Classifying the equality score into 3 types:
    * Fair (+-10)
    * Unfair (<-10 AND >10)
    * Highly Discriminative (<-20 AND >20)
  
## 💡 Key Learnings
Through this simulation, I gained valuable experience in:
1. Tools commonly used in professional analytics (Excel, Tableau, etc.)
2. How to tailor analysis for different stakeholders
3. Effective visualization techniques
